### class

class individual:
    """
    The 'individual' class represents an individual in a Genetic Algorithm (GA) used for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). This class defines the properties and behaviors of an individual, which includes generating random or specified paths, evaluating the fitness of a path, mutating the path, and performing crossover with another individual.

    Attributes:
        - n_cities (int): The number of cities in the TSP.
        - randomize (bool): A flag indicating whether to randomize the initial path.
        - fixed (list): An optional list specifying a fixed path if provided.

    Methods:
        - __init__(self, n_cities=None, randomize=True, fixed=None):
            Initializes an individual with a random or specified path.

        - evaluate(self, D):
            Evaluates the fitness of the current path based on a distance matrix 'D'. It calculates the total distance of the path and stores it.

        - mutate(self):
            Performs a mutation operation on the path by swapping two randomly selected cities.

        - crossover(self, other):
            Performs ordered crossover with another individual 'other' to generate a new individual with a combination of their paths.

        - __str__(self):
            Returns a string representation of the individual's path.

    Usage:
        # Create an individual with a random path of 10 cities
        ind = individual(n_cities=10)

        - initial_beta (float): The initial mutation strength (percentage of genes to mutate within an individual).
        - initial_gamma (float): The initial crossover rate (percentage of offspring produced through crossover).
        - max_iterations (int, optional): The maximum number of iterations for the GA.
        - early_stopping_rounds (int, optional): The number of consecutive iterations with no improvement to trigger early stopping.

    Returns:
        - statistics_df (pandas.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing statistics tracked during the training process, such as best individual, number of same individuals, quartiles, and more.

    Usage:
        - Provide a distance matrix ('distance_matrix') for evaluating fitness.
        - Specify the maximum number of cities to consider ('max_cities').
        - Set the number of individuals in the population ('n_individuals').
        - Initialize mutation rate ('initial_alpha'), mutation strength ('initial_beta'), and crossover rate ('initial_gamma').
        - Optionally, set the maximum number of iterations and early stopping rounds.

    Example:
        # Train a GA for TSP
        stats = train(distance_matrix, max_cities=10, n_individuals=50, initial_alpha=0.5, initial_beta=0.5, initial_gamma=0.5)

    The function trains a GA by repeatedly applying the 'epoch' function, tracking statistics, and adjusting hyperparameters over iterations.
    Early stopping is triggered if no improvement is observed over a specified number of rounds. Hyperparameters alpha, beta, and gamma are adjusted based on the convergence and diversity of the population.

    The 'visualize_path_on_map' function is used to visualize the path taken by an individual on an interactive map.
    It displays markers for cities and connects them in the order they are visited by the individual, creating a visual representation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) route.

    Parameters:
        - individual (individual): An instance of the 'individual' class representing the path to visualize.
        - cities_df (pandas.DataFrame): A DataFrame with columns 'city', 'lat' (latitude), and 'lng' (longitude) containing information about the cities.

    Returns:
        - m (folium.Map): An interactive folium map with markers for each city and lines connecting them in the order they are visited.

    Usage:
        - Provide an 'individual' instance representing the path to visualize.
        - Pass a pandas DataFrame ('cities_df') with city information, including latitude and longitude.

    Example:

    The main script for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a genetic algorithm with French cities data.
    It performs various tasks such as data loading, distance computation, training, and result saving.

    Usage:
        - Make sure you have the required libraries installed and the necessary data files (e.g., 'french_cities.json') available.
        - Customize the script by adjusting parameters, such as 'max_cities,' 'initial_alpha,' 'initial_gamma,' 'initial_beta,' 'max_iterations,' and 'early_stopping_rounds.'
        - Run the script to execute the TSP solving process and save the results.

    Example:
        # Customize parameters
        max_cities = 241
        initial_alpha = 1
        initial_gamma = 1
